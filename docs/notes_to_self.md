# Controlling position
- I can control velocities
- Based on goal position figure out ideal optimal time I should be setting goal velocities 
I have the sign convention flipped for y axis someway somehow, need to fix it

## Low Level Controls stuff
- Get transfer function modeling for the following:
  - Theta/elevator
  - Theta/Thrust
  - Airspeed/elevator
  - Airspeed/Thrust  
  - Phi/aileron 

For radar stuff;
- Write a function with a symbolic value for radar
- Call function out to set the value of the RCS
-
