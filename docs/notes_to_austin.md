- Missing the following in the first sheet:
  - c_drag_0
  - lift coefficient calculation,C_l:
    - Changes as a function of alpha but for now steady level flight
      - Using equation $L=W=mg$
    - c_drag_a computations from spreadsheet:
      - Where does the 6 come from aspect ratio? 
      - Forgot a parenthesis
  - M_de calcs
    - Used airspeed should be dynamic
    - Should be -cm_deltae 

- I don't think dynamic A's and B's will work:
  - Would need to trim then find the A's and B's for that then adjust 
- Have better results setting using Nominal A and B matrices
