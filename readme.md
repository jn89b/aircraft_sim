# Aircraft Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive simulation for aircraft dynamics and control. It includes a variety of scripts and data files aimed at simulating different aspects of aircraft behavior and control systems.

## Features
- Dynamic aircraft simulation (`dynamic_lon.py`)
- Guidance simulation (`guidance_sim.py`)
- Main simulation interface (`main_sim.py`)
- Data files for coefficients and controls (`Coeffs.csv`, `MPC_Plane_controls.csv`, `MPC_Plane_states.csv`)
- Extensive documentation and tests

## Installation
### Run Virtual environment
First initialize your virtual environment 

```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Once done you can use the bash script to activate your virtual environment using the following command

```
source run_venv.sh
```

### Python dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Explain how to run the main scripts and any configurations or settings that can be adjusted.
