# Aircraft Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive simulation for aircraft dynamics and control. It includes a variety of scripts and data files aimed at simulating different aspects of aircraft behavior and control systems.

## Features
- Dynamic aircraft simulation (`dynamic_lon.py`)
- Guidance simulation (`guidance_sim.py`)
- Main simulation interface (`main_sim.py`)
- Data files for coefficients and controls (`Coeffs.csv`, `MPC_Plane_controls.csv`, `MPC_Plane_states.csv`)
- Extensive documentation and tests
